# LiquidCrystal_I2C-linux
This repository is a python port of the Arduino [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://gitlab.informatika.org/IF3111-2017-K01-01/arduino/-/tree/e226a48d5cb3735b7fa6f08e3169188495677fe6/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library-master) library.

With this library you can connect your I2C lcd to your linux box (using available GPIOs, but also via the I2C pins of your [VGA port](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/hd44780)) and control it like you did with the C++ library.

# Supported devices
This library by default will handle most common type of character lcds based on the Hitachi HD44780 with PCF8574 I2C backpack:

40x2, 20x4, 20x2, 16x2, 16x1 (type 2), 16x4

displays not supported by this:
- 16x1 (type 1), This uses a discontigous memory for the single line
(It's not particularly difficult to make it work, but you have to use it as an 8x2 display)
- 40x4 is dual 40x2 displays using dual E signals which is not supported

See here for further explanation of lcd memory addressing:

# Installation
0. Use `raspi-config` to enable the I2C interface (only for Raspberry Pi and similar boards)

1. Enable i2c kernel module
  ```sh
  sudo modprobe i2c-dev
  ```

2. Add your user to i2c group
  ```sh
  sudo usermod -a -G i2c $(whoami)
  ```
  To apply group change, depending on the case, you may need to:
  - Close and reopen your terminal window (if you are in a desktop environment)
  - Log-out and log-in again in your tty session (if you use a computer without a desktop environment)
  - Restart your ssh session (if you are connected to a remote device, maybe a Raspberry)

3. List all available I2C buses
  ```sh
  ls /dev/i2c-*
  ```

4. Scan for devices on the first bus
  ```sh
  i2cdetect -y 0
  ```

5. Connect your device

6. Scan again the same bus and look for new devices. If you see a new device you're done, otherwise repeat from step 4, scanning the other available buses until you find your device. (each bus corresponds to a physical connection so, if you change the device, you don't need to scan all the buses)<br>If you still can't find it try checking the cables and trying again.

7. Installing the library
  ```sh
  python3 -m pip install liquidcrystal_i2c-linux
  ```

# Implementation
## Getting Started
### Basic commands:
- **Initialization**
  ```python
  from liquidcrystal_i2c import LCD
  ```
  Initialize the lcd using bus and address you found before.<br>
  If cols and rows are not specified, library assumes 16x2.<br>
  ```python
  lcd = LCD(bus=1, addr=0x3e, cols=16, rows=2)
  ```
  At this point the lcd is already cleared and the cursor set to home, so we don't need to call lcd.clear() and lcd.home() again.<br>
  However when you need to clear all and place the cursor at 0,0 use:
  ```python
  lcd.clear()
  lcd.home()
  ```
- **Printing**<br>
  Place the cursor where you want to print (remember numbers start from zero so 0 will be the first column/row).
  ```python
  lcd.setCursor(3,1)
  lcd.print("Hello, world!")
  ```
- **Printing special characters**<br>
  Thanks to [The Raspberry Pi guy](https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy)'s [library](https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd) we have two methods to print special characters:
  
  1. classic LiquidCrystal_I2C way
  ```python
  lcd.setCursor(2,1)
  lcd.write(0xF7) #prints Ï€ symbol
  ```
  2. new The Raspberry Pi guy's way
  ```python
  lcd.setCursor(2,1)
  lcd.printExt("Hello {0xF7}")
  ```
  Warning: if you use this method with string `format` you need to escape the placeholder using double curly brackets.
  ```python
  lcd.setCursor(2,1)
  lcd.printExt("Hello {{0xF7}} = {0}".format(3.14))
  ```
- **Printing custom characters**<br>
  The HD44780 allows to define 8 custom characters that you can load in CGRAM and call like any other special character.
  The 8 character slots are numbered from 0 to 7, their placeholders are obviously `{0x00},{0x01},{0x02},{0x03},{0x04},{0x05},{0x06},{0x07}`.
  ```python
  # define custom character bitmap
  # you can design the character using https://maxpromer.github.io/LCD-Character-Creator/ but keep in mind that byte definitions are different between C++ and Python
  custom_char_cpu = [
    0b01010,
    0b11111,
    0b10001,
    0b10101,
    0b10001,
    0b11111,
    0b01010,
    0b00000
  ]
  # now it's time to load the character
  # we will use slot 3
  lcd.createChar(3, custom_char_cpu)
  # print the character as all special characters
  lcd.setCursor(0,0)
  lcd.printExt("This is a CPU: {0x03}")
  ```
### Other commands:
- Turn backlight on/off
  ```python
  lcd.backlight()
  lcd.noBacklight()
  ```
- Show/hide cursor
  ```python
  lcd.cursor()
  lcd.noCursor()
  ```
- Turn cursor blinking on/off (needs cursor to be enabled)
  ```python
  lcd.blink()
  lcd.noBlink()
  ```
- Show hide all text
  ```python
  lcd.display()
  lcd.noDisplay()
  ```
- Scroll the entire display by one place left/right without resending strings
  ```python
  lcd.scrollDisplayLeft()
  lcd.scrollDisplayRight()
  ```
- Set autoscroll on/off
  ```python
  lcd.autoscroll()
  lcd.noAutoscroll()
  ```
- Set writing direction
  ```python
  lcd.leftToRight()
  lcd.rightToLeft()
  ```

## Systemd
Use the following procedure to run any LCD Python script as a (systemd) service:

1. Create a new unit file in `/lib/systemd/system/` called `i2c-lcd.service`:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/i2c-lcd.service
   ```

2. Copy and paste the following in the new unit file:
   ```sh
   [Unit]
   Description=Python script for an hd44780 LCD

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ## Edit the following according to the script permissions
   User=<YOUR-USERNAME>
   #Group=users

   ## Edit the following with the full path to your script
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py

   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5

   KillMode=process
   KillSignal=SIGINT

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Enable the service and start it:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable i2c-lcd.service
   sudo systemctl start i2c-lcd.service
   ```

4. Check that the LCD is displaying the correct information; otherwise, check the service status:
   ```sh
   systemctl status i2c-lcd.service
   ```

# Thanks
I'd like to thank the creators of the C++ library for their awesome work, and [The Raspberry Pi guy](https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy) for the `printExt` function, derived from his [`lcd_display_extended_string`](https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd/blob/master/drivers/i2c_dev.py).
